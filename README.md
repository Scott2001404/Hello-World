# Hello-World
My first repostory, there's just just few words to give it a try.
- What is my NAME: Lang Qin, but you can also call me Scott if you've found my name was not easy to say and remember.
- Who are you: I am a student studying at DTU- Technical University of Denmark for a master's degree, my programme is the Design and Innovarion, which conbines both engineering and humane perspectives to make the technology is made for people.
- Why are you using the Github: I bielive programming is an essential skill for the people living in the morden society, especially under the emergence of the Artificial Intelligence, programming and coding will be more fun and intuitive with the help of AI, so why not using the Github to learn something and discover a new world. Besides, I always think programming is a cool thing, and I was good at C prgramming language during my first year of my Bachelor's. I hope I will enjoy programming. Lastly, I found there are so many cool things to learn in the Github, it's like a encyclopedia where I can learn everything for free basically, and I've heard it is also a platform where I can meet all kind of fun people, hope I will make friends here.
